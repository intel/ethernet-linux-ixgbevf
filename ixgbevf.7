.TH ixgbevf 1 "November 3, 2016"
.SH NAME
ixgbevf \-This file describes the Linux* Base Driver
for the Gigabit Family of Adapters.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe ixgbevf [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.6.x\fR or later kernels. A version of the driver may already be included by your distribution and/or the kernel.org kernel.

This driver includes support for any 64 bit Linux supported system, including Itanium(R)2, x86_64, PPC64, ARM, etc.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the drivers.


For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.
.LP
.B InterruptThrottleRate
.IP
.B Valid Range:
0=off
1=dynamic
<min_ITR>-<max_ITR>
.IP
Interrupt Throttle Rate controls the number of interrupts each interrupt
vector can generate per second. Increasing ITR lowers latency at the cost of
increased CPU utilization, though it may help throughput in some circumstances.
.IP
0 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to 0 turns off any interrupt moderation
  and may improve small packet latency. However, this is generally not
  suitable for bulk throughput traffic due to the increased CPU utilization
  of the higher interrupt rate.
  NOTES:
  - On 82599, and X540, and X550-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate
    will also result in the driver disabling HW RSC.
  - On 82598-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate will also
    result in disabling LRO (Large Receive Offloads).
.IP
1 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to Dynamic mode attempts to moderate
  interrupts per vector while maintaining very low latency. This can
  sometimes cause extra CPU utilization. If planning on deploying ixgbevf
  in a latency sensitive environment, this parameter should be considered.
.IP
<min_ITR>-<max_ITR> = 956-488281
  Setting InterruptThrottleRate to a value greater or equal to <min_ITR>
  will program the adapter to send at most that many interrupts
  per second, even if more packets have come in. This reduces interrupt load
  on the system and can lower CPU utilization under heavy load, but will
  increase latency as packets are not processed as quickly.

.SH ethtool
.LP
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest ethtool version is required for this functionality. Download it at:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/


.SH SUPPORT
.LP
